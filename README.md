# two-sum

This repository has been created to compare three methods to solve the challenge below.

> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

The three solutions are

  - brute force
  - mapping elements and indexes to a hash then iterating through the array
  - iterating and mapping in one pass
